# Data Structures Project

My final project in the Data Structures class  tasked me with recreating the classic arcade game Asteroids in Java. This project required the integration of various methods and classes to bring together a game closely resembling the original Asteroids.

This assignment significantly contributed to my computer science and college-wide learning goals in several key ways:

### System-Level Understanding of the Computer: 
This project deepened my understanding of how computer systems handle graphical rendering, user input, and game logic. It involved working with Java's libraries and APIs, which are essential for developing software that interacts with the underlying system.

### To understand the concepts and techniques of software design: 
This project was a valuable introduction to software design for me. It involved creating a substantial program, which emphasized the importance of organization and structuring code effectively. Learning how to design and manage multiple classes and their interactions was a crucial takeaway.

### To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting: 
This was a solo project where I gained valuable experience working on a project on my own

### To develop effective problem solving skills: 
Developing a game like Asteroids involves solving issues like graphical interfaces and collision issues. This project honed my problem-solving skills as I had to find innovative solutions to these gameplay-related issues.

In conclusion, the Data Structures project played a significant role in my computer science and college-wide learning goals. It deepened my understanding of computer systems and software design, provided practical project experience, and enhanced my problem-solving skillsâ€”key attributes for a computer science student.
